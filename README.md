## 🧐 Why I Built This (The Problem)
While tracking mutual funds and global markets, I noticed several critical flaws in popular platforms like Moneycontrol, Paytm Money, and Groww:

1.  **Platform Bias:** Most apps feature "Sponsored Funds" at the top of their lists. Even when sorting by performance, these promoted funds clutter the view, making it hard to find the true winners.
2.  **Missing "Very Long Term" Data:** Most retail platforms cap historical data at 5 or 10 years. For a true long-term investor, seeing the **15, 20, or 30-year CAGR** is vital to understanding how a fund survives different market cycles.
3.  **Fragmented Tracking:** No single platform allows you to compare an Indian Small Cap fund directly against the NASDAQ-100 or a specialized European Index in one unified view.
4.  **Currency Blindness:** To understand true global performance, you must view returns in **USD terms**. A 10% return in a local currency like the Lira (Turkey) or Yuan (China) might actually be a loss when adjusted for USD depreciation.

* **Unbiased Ranking:** Zero sponsored listings. Funds are ranked purely on raw data and custom "Performance Scores."
* **Deep Historical Context:** Tracks performance horizons up to **35 years**, allowing for multi-decade wealth analysis.
* **Global Macro Comparison:** Compare the performance of diverse indices (Turkey, Hong Kong, China, India, Europe, UK, Germany) normalized in **USD terms** to see which markets are truly creating value.
* **Cost vs. Performance:** Integrated **Expense Ratio** tracking to ensure that high performance isn't being eaten away by high fees.
